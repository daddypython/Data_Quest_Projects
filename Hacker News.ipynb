    "The Hacker News is a leading, trusted, and widely recognized cybersecurity news platform that attracts over 8 million readers monthly, including IT professionals, researchers, hackers, technologists, and enthusiasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "At Hacker News, one will find the latest cybersecurity news and in-depth reports on current and future Infosec trends and how they are shaping the cyber world.\n",

    "### Project File & Coding\n",
    "Original data set can be foundd at https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this project, the original data set had been reduced to to approximately 20,101 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reduced data set used for this project is saved as 'hacker.csv'. \n",

    "4. In each hour, for 'Ask HN', the total number of posts and comments.\n",

    "5. In each hour, for 'Ask HN', the average number of comments recieved. \n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The above analysis shows that there are 582 more posts beggining with 'Ask HN' than \"Show HN'.  There are also 12,495 more comments submitted for 'Ask HN'. Based on the number of posts included in the 'hacker.csv', on average 'Ask HN' recieved about 3.7 more comments than 'Show HN'.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Most of these posts and comments were submitted in the '15:00' hour. In total, 4,477 comments were submitted in the '15:00' hour which is 2,663 higher than 1,814 comments submitted during the '16:00' hour (the second highest). The difference in the number of posts between the hour '15:00' (116 posts) and '19:00' (the second highest) is 6 posts. Therefore, '15:00' hour is undoubtedly the most popular hour for submitting both the posts and the comments and this is reflected by by the highest average comments per posts recieved by hour '15:00'. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### However, this may not be true for '02:00' hour which is second on the list with 23.81 average comments per post.  It is '16:00' hour with the second highest number of comments (1,814) followed by:\n",
    "##### - '21:00' with 1,745 comments,\n",
    "##### - '20:00' with 1,722 comments,\n",
    "##### - '18:00' with 1,439 comments,\n",
    "##### - '14:00' with 1,416 comments,\n",
    "##### - followed by '02:00' hour with 1,381 comments. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Even in terms of the number of posts submitted, '02:00' is ranked 15th highest with 58 posts which is 52 posts less than '19:00' hour (with the second highest number of posts). \n",
    "\n",
    "##### It appears that the following hours are more popular than '02:00' hour for the submission of both the posts and the comments:\n",
    "##### - '16:00' with 108 posts and 1,814 comments \n",
    "##### - '21:00' with 109 posts and 1745 comments. \n",
    "##### - '20:00' with 80 posts and 1,722 comments\n",
    "##### - '18:00' with 109 posts and 1,439 comments\n",
    "##### - '14:00' with 107 posts and 1,416 comments\n",
    "\n",
    "##### In comparison,  '02:00' hours with 58 posts and 1,381 comments has attained the second spot because during this hour there are far less posts. This gives '02:00' hour a higher average for comments per post. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Therefore, in the top 5 hours based on the average comments per post, the findings of '15:00', '16:00'. '20:00'. and '21:00' seems logical if the purpose of this exercise is to find out during which hours the users are most active in terms of submitting posts and comments. Accordingly, '18:00' and '14:00' hours appears to be better candidates than '02:00' hour.   \n"
